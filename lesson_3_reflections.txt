1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to create a remote repository when you are collaborating with someone else or are working from different machines (for some odd reason).

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would want to pull them manually so that I know what I am pulling and only pull the branches/commits I feel I would need on my local files.
